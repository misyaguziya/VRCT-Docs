## Send a message.
There are two ways to send a message.

1. **Using the chat input field**  
   You can send a message by typing it into the chat input field in the main window of VRCT and pressing the Enter key (or Send button).

2. **Using the microphone**  
   You can also send a message using your voice with the microphone. VRCT will recognize your speech, convert it to text, and send it.
