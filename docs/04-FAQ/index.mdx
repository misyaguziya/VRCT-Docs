# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

This section addresses common questions about using VRCT.

## Getting Started

### Q: Which transcription engine should I use?

VRCT offers two main transcription engines:

- **Whisper**: Recommended for most users
  - Works completely offline
  - More stable and reliable
  - Best for unstable network connections
  - Does not require external API access

- **Google**: Alternative option
  - Requires stable internet connection
  - May not work in some regions with limited Google access
  - Can be affected by network issues

**Recommendation**: Start with Whisper for the most reliable experience.

See the [Transcription Engine Guide](/docs/feature-guide/transcription-engines) for more details.

### Q: Which translation engine is best?

The choice depends on your needs:

- **DeepL**: High-quality translations, especially for European languages
- **Google Translate**: Wide language support, good for general use
- **LLM APIs**: More natural and context-aware translations

Each engine has different strengths. Try a few to see which works best for your language pair.

See the [Translation Engine Guide](/docs/feature-guide/translation-engines) for more details.

### Q: Do I need to run VRCT as administrator?

In most cases, no. However, you may need administrator privileges if:

- Speaker2Log feature doesn't work properly
- VRCT cannot access audio devices
- You encounter permission-related errors

Try running as administrator if you experience issues with audio device detection.

### Q: Why isn't my transcription working?

Common solutions:

1. **Check your microphone/speaker settings** in Windows
2. **Try switching transcription engines** (Whisper is more reliable)
3. **Verify audio device selection** in VRCT settings
4. **Check if multiple audio devices** with the same name exist - disable unused ones
5. **Restart VRCT** if settings changes don't take effect
