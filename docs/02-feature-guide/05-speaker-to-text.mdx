# Speaker to Text (Speaker2Log)

The Speaker to Text feature (Speaker2Log) allows you to transcribe system audio output to text. This is perfect for capturing and translating what other players are saying in VRChat voice chat.

## Overview

Speaker2Log captures audio from your selected speaker/audio output device and:
1. Transcribes the audio to text
2. Translates the transcribed text (if translation is enabled)
3. Displays the results in the chat history

This allows you to "read" what others are saying through voice chat.

## How to Enable

1. Disable Speaker2Log in VRCT first
2. Change the speaker device in Windows
3. Update the speaker device in VRCT settings
4. Re-enable Speaker2Log
:::

### Privacy Considerations

Be aware that Speaker2Log transcribes ALL audio from the selected device, including:
- VRChat voice chat
- Desktop audio
- Music, videos, or other applications using that audio device

## Best Practices

### For Better Accuracy

1. **Clear Audio Source**: Ensure good audio quality from VRChat
2. **Reduce Background Noise**: Minimize desktop audio from other applications
3. **Proper Volume Levels**: Set VRChat voice volume to appropriate levels
4. **Select Correct Language**: Configure the expected language in settings

### For VRChat Usage

1. **Volume Balance**: Adjust VRChat voice volume for optimal transcription
2. **Monitor System Resources**: Speaker transcription can be resource-intensive

## Use Cases

### Accessibility

- For players with hearing difficulties
- Read voice chat as text
- Keep conversation logs

### Communication Support

- Bridge language barriers in international worlds
- Understand conversations in worlds where you don't speak the language
- Keep written records of voice conversations

## Troubleshooting

### Speaker Transcription Not Working

- Verify the correct audio device is selected in settings
- Check that the device is not muted in Windows
- Ensure VRChat audio is playing through the selected device
- Test audio playback in Windows

### Poor Transcription Accuracy

- Increase VRChat voice volume
- Reduce background application audio
- Select the correct source language
- Try a different transcription engine
- Check audio output quality

### VRCT Freezing

- Disable Speaker2Log before changing Windows audio devices
- Restart VRCT if frozen
- Check system resources (CPU/GPU/RAM)

### Cannot Hear Audio

- Check Windows audio settings
- Verify VRChat audio output device
- Check application mixer volumes

## Performance Considerations

### System Resources

Speaker transcription requires:
- Continuous CPU/GPU processing
- RAM for audio buffering
- More resources than microphone transcription (processes all desktop audio)

### Optimization Tips

1. Use lighter transcription models
2. Close unnecessary audio applications
3. Disable when not needed
4. Adjust transcription quality vs performance in settings

- Don't share transcribed private conversations without permission

### Data Handling
