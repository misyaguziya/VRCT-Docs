# Language Presets

Language Presets allow you to save and quickly switch between frequently used language combinations. You can configure up to 3 presets for instant access.

## Overview

Instead of manually selecting languages every time, you can:
- Save your most-used language combinations as presets
- Switch between presets with a single click
- Configure different translation engines for each preset

This is especially useful when you regularly communicate in different language groups.

## How to Use

### Preset Tabs

In the main window, you'll see three preset tabs:
- **Preset 1**
- **Preset 2**
- **Preset 3**

### Switching Presets

1. Click on any preset tab (1, 2, or 3)
2. VRCT immediately switches to that preset's language configuration
3. All language settings and translation engines update automatically

## Configuring Presets

### Configure While Active

1. Switch to the preset you want to configure
2. Set your desired languages:
   - Your Language
   - Target Language(s)
   - Translation Engines
3. The preset automatically saves your configuration

## Preset Configuration

Each preset can store:
- **Your Language**: The language you speak/type
- **Target Language(s)**: Up to 3 target languages
- **Translation Engines**: Different engine for each target language
- **Additional Settings**: Preset-specific translation preferences

## Use Cases

### Example 1: International Communities

If you frequently visit different VRChat communities:

- **Preset 1**: English → Japanese (for JP communities)
- **Preset 2**: English → Korean (for KR communities)
- **Preset 3**: English → Spanish (for ES communities)

### Example 2: Multilingual Friend Groups

- **Preset 1**: English → Japanese + Korean (Asian friends)
- **Preset 2**: English → Spanish + French (European friends)
- **Preset 3**: Japanese → English (reverse translation)

## Best Practices

### Organize by Context

1. **Community-Based**: One preset per VRChat community you visit
2. **Language-Based**: One preset per primary language pair
3. **Purpose-Based**: Casual chat, serious discussion

### Test Your Presets

After configuring:
1. Switch between presets
2. Test each one with sample messages
3. Ensure languages and engines are correct

## Troubleshooting

### Languages Not Switching

- Verify you clicked the preset tab
- Check the language indicators updated
- Restart VRCT if presets seem stuck

### Translation Engine Not Changing

- Some engines require API keys to be configured first
- Check the engine is available for your language pair
- Verify internet connection (for cloud engines)
