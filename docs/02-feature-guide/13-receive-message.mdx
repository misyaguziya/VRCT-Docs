# Receive Message

Learn how to receive and translate messages from other players in VRChat using VRCT's speaker transcription feature.

## Overview

VRCT can capture audio from your speakers and:
1. Transcribe the audio to text
2. Translate the transcribed text
3. Display in chat history for you to read

This allows you to "read" what others are saying through voice chat, even in different languages.

## Enable Speaker Transcription

### Toggle Speaker2Log

1. In the main window, locate the **Speaker2Log** toggle switch
2. Click to enable speaker transcription
3. Ensure your speaker/audio device is correctly selected in settings

:::warning[Important]
Before enabling, make sure the correct speaker/audio output device is selected in [Device Settings](/docs/config-device).
:::

## Configuration

### Select Audio Output Device

1. Open Settings (click gear icon)
2. Navigate to **Device** Tab
3. Select the audio output device VRChat is using
4. Save settings

:::tip[Tip]

### Configure Transcription

1. Open Settings
2. Navigate to **Transcription** tab
3. Configure speaker transcription engine
4. Adjust language settings
5. Save changes

For detailed transcription settings, see the [Transcription Settings Guide](/docs/config-transcription).

3. VRCT transcribes their voice to text
4. Transcribed text appears in chat history (left side)

### With Translation

1. Enable both **Translation** and **Speaker2Log** toggles
2. Set expected source language (language they're speaking)
3. Set your preferred target language (your language)
4. When someone speaks:
   - Audio is transcribed to text
   - Text is automatically translated
   - Both original and translation appear in chat history

## Message Display

### Reading Messages

- Messages appear in real-time as others speak
- Scroll to view older messages

## Manual Language Selection

For better accuracy, manually set the expected source language:

1. Know which language the person is speaking
2. Set that as the source language in VRCT
3. More accurate transcription and translation

## Multi-Speaker Scenarios

### Multiple People Speaking

When multiple people are talking:
- select multiple target languages if needed
- VRCT transcribes all audio from the speaker device (when audio is available for the selected languages)
- May mix transcriptions together
- Difficult to separate different speakers
- Best when one person speaks at a time

### Simultaneous Speech

If multiple people speak simultaneously:
- Transcription accuracy decreases
- Mixed or garbled text may result
- Translation may be unreliable
- Wait for clear audio for best results

## Important Warnings

### Device Change Warning

:::warning[Critical]
**DO NOT change the speaker device in Windows while Speaker2Log is active.**

If you need to change the speaker device:
1. **Disable Speaker2Log in VRCT first**
2. Change the speaker device in Windows
3. Update the device in VRCT settings
4. Re-enable Speaker2Log

Changing devices while active may cause VRCT to freeze or crash.

### Privacy Considerations

Speaker transcription captures **ALL audio** from the selected device:
- VRChat voice chat
- Music or videos playing
- Other application sounds
- Desktop notifications

**Use responsibly and ethically:**

- Follow VRChat community guidelines
- Use for accessibility and communication assistance only

## Use Cases

### Record Keeping

- Keep written logs of voice conversations
- Review important information later
- Remember what was discussed
- Create conversation archives

## Best Practices

### For Better Transcription

1. **Good Audio Quality**: Ensure clear VRChat voice
2. **Appropriate Volume**: Not too loud, not too quiet
3. **Reduce Background Noise**: Minimize other application sounds
4. **Correct Language Setting**: Set expected source language

### For Better Translation

1. **Select Appropriate Engine**: Choose engine good at the language pair
2. **Context Awareness**: Understand conversation context

### For VRChat Etiquette

1. **Use Discreetly**: Don't announce you're transcribing
2. **Respect Privacy**: Don't share transcripts without permission
4. **Help Others**: Share translations to help communication

## Troubleshooting

### No Transcription Appearing

- Verify Speaker2Log toggle is enabled
- Check correct audio device is selected
- Ensure VRChat audio is playing through that device
- Test audio output in Windows
- Check microphone isn't capturing instead

### Poor Transcription Quality

- Increase VRChat voice volume
- Reduce other application audio
- Ensure correct source language is set
- Try different transcription engine
- Check audio device quality and drivers

### Translation Not Accurate

- Verify correct source and target languages
- Try different translation engine
- Check if transcription is accurate first
- Consider context and slang usage
- Manual translation for important messages

### VRCT Freezing

- Disable Speaker2Log before changing audio devices
- Check system resources (CPU/GPU/RAM)
- Close resource-intensive applications
- Restart VRCT if frozen
- Update VRCT to latest version

### Can't Hear VRChat Audio

- Verify audio device isn't muted
- Check Windows volume mixer
- Ensure VRChat is outputting to correct device
- Test audio with other applications

## Performance Optimization

### System Resources

Speaker transcription is resource-intensive:
- Continuous audio processing
- Real-time transcription
- Translation processing
- More demanding than microphone transcription

### Optimization Tips

1. **Use Lighter Models**: Select faster transcription engines
2. **Reduce Other Apps**: Close unnecessary applications
3. **Disable When Not Needed**: Turn off when not actively using
4. **Optimize Settings**: Balance quality vs performance
