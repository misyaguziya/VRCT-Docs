# Voice to Text (Voice2Chatbox)

The Voice to Text feature (Voice2Chatbox) allows you to speak into your microphone and have VRCT convert your speech to text, which can then be translated and sent to VRChat chatbox.

## Overview

Instead of typing messages, you can simply speak into your microphone. VRCT will:
1. Capture your voice through the selected microphone
2. Transcribe the speech to text
3. Translate the text (if translation is enabled)
4. Send the message to VRChat chatbox via OSC

## How to Enable

## Best Practices

### For Better Accuracy

1. **Speak Clearly**: Enunciate words clearly at a moderate pace
2. **Reduce Background Noise**: Use in a quiet environment or use a noise-cancelling microphone
3. **Proper Microphone Position**: Keep the microphone at an appropriate distance from your mouth
4. **Use Good Quality Microphone**: Better hardware improves transcription accuracy

### For VRChat Usage

1. **Configure VRChat OSC**: Ensure VRChat OSC is enabled
2. **Check Microphone Mute**: Don't confuse VRCT microphone with VRChat voice chat
3. **Monitor Character Limit**: VRChat chatbox has a 144-character limit
4. **Use Mute Sync (Optional)**: Configure mute sync settings if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Working

- Check if the correct microphone is selected in settings
- Verify microphone is not muted in Windows
- Test microphone in Windows settings

### Poor Transcription Accuracy

- Select the correct language in transcription settings
- Reduce background noise
- Speak more clearly and at moderate pace
- Try a different transcription engine
- Check microphone quality and position

### Delay in Transcription

- Check system resources (CPU/GPU usage)
- Close unnecessary applications
- Try a lighter transcription model
- Ensure stable internet connection (for cloud-based engines)

### Message Not Sent to VRChat

- Verify VRChat OSC is enabled
- Check OSC settings in VRCT
- Restart VRChat and VRCT
- See [OSC Integration Guide](./osc-integration)

## Privacy Considerations

### Local vs Cloud Processing

- **Local Engines**: Processing happens on your computer, more private
- **Cloud Engines**: Audio may be sent to external servers for processing

Choose the appropriate engine based on your privacy preferences in the transcription settings.

## Performance Tips

### Reduce CPU/GPU Usage

- Use lighter transcription models
- Disable when not needed
- Close other resource-intensive applications

### Improve Response Time

- Use cloud-based engines (requires internet)
- Ensure sufficient system resources
- Optimize Windows audio settings
