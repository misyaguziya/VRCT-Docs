# Overlay Mode (VR)

Overlay Mode allows you to display the VRCT interface directly in VR as an overlay, making it easy to view translations and chat history while playing VRChat in VR.

## Overview

When using VRChat in VR, you can:
- View VRCT interface inside your VR headset
- Position and resize the overlay window
- Read translations without leaving VR
- Interact with VRCT while in-game

## How to Enable

### Open Overlay Settings

1. In the VRCT main window, click the **Overlay(VR)** button
2. The Overlay settings window will open
3. Configure your overlay preferences

2. The VRCT interface will appear in your VR headset
3. Adjust position and settings as needed

## Overlay Configuration

### Position and Size

**Position**:
- Move the overlay by grabbing and dragging
- Position relative to your play space or head
- Save position for future sessions

**Size**:
- Adjust overlay scale/size
- Make it larger for better readability
- Smaller for less obstruction

**Distance**:
- Set how far the overlay appears from you
- Closer for better readability
- Further away to avoid obstruction

### Attachment Mode

**World-Locked**:
- Overlay stays in a fixed position in the world
- Doesn't move when you turn your head
- Good for stationary reading

**Head-Locked**:
- Overlay follows your head movement
- Always visible in your field of view
- Good for constant monitoring

**Wrist-Locked**:
- Overlay attached to your wrist
- Visible when you raise your hand
- Convenient for quick glances

### Opacity

- Adjust transparency of the overlay
- Higher opacity: Easier to read, more obstructive
- Lower opacity: Less obstructive, harder to read
- Find the balance that works for you

## Display Options

### What to Show

Configure which elements appear in the overlay:
- Chat history
- Input field
- Translation controls
- Language settings
- Minimal UI (chat only)

### Font Size

- Adjust text size for VR readability
- Larger text is easier to read in VR
- Balance size with available space

### Color Theme

- Choose colors optimized for VR
- High contrast for better readability
- Dark mode to reduce eye strain

## Using Overlay in VR

### Reading Translations

1. Enable Speaker2Log to transcribe others' voices
2. View transcribed and translated text in the overlay
3. Read while continuing to interact in VRChat

### Sending Messages

**Method 1: Voice Input**
- Enable Voice2Chatbox
- Speak into your microphone
- Message automatically sent to chatbox

**Method 2: VR Keyboard** (if supported)
- Use VR keyboard to type
- Select input field in overlay
- Type and send messages

### Interaction

Use VR controllers to:
- Point and click on overlay elements
- Scroll through chat history
- Toggle settings
- Adjust overlay position

## VR Headset Compatibility

### Tested Headsets

- Meta Quest (Link/Air Link)
- Meta Quest 2
- Meta Quest 3
- Valve Index
- HTC Vive / Vive Pro
- Windows Mixed Reality headsets
- Other SteamVR-compatible headsets

## Performance Considerations

### System Resources

Overlay mode requires additional resources:
- GPU rendering for VR overlay
- SteamVR overlay system
- May impact VRChat performance slightly

### Optimization Tips

1. Use minimal UI mode (show only chat)
2. Reduce overlay size if not needed
3. Lower opacity when not actively reading
4. Disable overlay when not using VR

## Best Practices

### Positioning

1. **Test Different Positions**: Find what works best for your play style
2. **Avoid Center View**: Don't block important game elements
3. **Easy to Glance**: Position where you can quickly check translations

### Readability

1. **Sufficient Size**: Make text large enough to read comfortably
2. **High Contrast**: Use colors that stand out
3. **Proper Distance**: Not too close (hard to focus) or too far (hard to read)

### Workflow

1. **Enable When Needed**: Turn on overlay for conversations
2. **Disable When Not**: Turn off during activities or events
3. **Quick Toggle**: Set up hotkey for quick enable/disable

## Troubleshooting

### Overlay Not Appearing

- Ensure SteamVR is running
- Check if VR headset is properly connected
- Restart VRCT and SteamVR
- Verify overlay is enabled in settings

### Overlay Not Visible in VRChat

- Check overlay distance and position settings
- Ensure opacity is high enough
- Try resetting overlay position
- Check SteamVR overlay permissions

### Performance Issues

- Reduce overlay size
- Use minimal UI mode
- Close unnecessary applications
- Lower VRChat graphics settings
- Check GPU usage and temperature

### Can't Interact with Overlay

- Verify controller tracking is working
- Check SteamVR controller bindings
- Try pointing from different angles
- Restart SteamVR

### Text Hard to Read

- Increase font size
- Adjust overlay distance (bring closer)
- Increase contrast
- Use high-contrast color theme
- Clean VR lenses

## Advanced Settings

### Multiple Overlays

- Display multiple VRCT elements as separate overlays
- Position each independently
- Show different information in different locations

### Custom Layouts

- Create custom overlay layouts
- Save different configurations
- Switch between layouts for different purposes

For advanced overlay configuration, see the [VR Settings Guide](/config-vr).
